My team members and I researched a [report](https://github.com/hydure/hydure.github.io/blob/master/files/Project4.docx) about securing data in the cloud.

In the course "Prevention of Cyber Attack Methodologies" my classmates and I were assigned groups where we were tasked to define and develop a software development life cycle report for an imaginary bank's cloud computing architect. I wrote all the information in the "Concepts and Scope", "Evaluation of Technology", and the "Systems Design Specifications" sections.

tl;dr

The report provides a foundational understanding of effectively designing, developing and testing a standard cloud computing environment for a stereotypical bank.
