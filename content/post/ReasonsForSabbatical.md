A post mentioning the numerous reasons for not having updated my blog in the last several months.
<!--more-->
I have not updated my blog as of late because of my new career change, finishing up my studies for my latest degree, and spending my free time studying for Microsoft certifications.

Regarding my career change, I was formerly working as a Scientist (Software Engineer) for the US Department of the Navy where I developed applications to aid in ship design and analysis. I had a lot of fun programming with my team and found the work incredibly challenging but lacking in both pay and benefits. So I applied to numerous places and received numerous offers, one of them being an offer from Microsoft to be a full-time Consultant developing and implementing solutions for customers back in May. The job has proven fun, challenging, and an all around blast and I plan to continue working for Microsoft for at least the next few years.

Regarding my latest degree, I finished up a year-and-a-half-long master's degree in Cybersecurity Technology from the University of Maryland, which was both challenging and fun as well as incredibly time-consuming (especially after a full day of work). I treasured my fellow classmates and the information I learned from the program, whose results have already proven beneficial at my current job. I plan on pursuing more degrees, having already been accepted to Johns Hopkins' School of Engineering for a master's in Data Science. I am currently awaiting approval for Georgia Tech's School of Engineering's master's in Cybersecurity program, as well as UNC's School of Business MBA program. Hopefully I get accepted into at least one of those as well.

Regarding the Microsoft certifications, I have been trying to complete all the MTAs I can, as well as a few Azure cloud certifications, to help bolster my resume to make up for my current lack of technical experience. I would rather not provide an exhaustive list, as my LinkedIn profile already does that and I don't think the certifications I've earned are anything to brag about.

So there you have it! I will be making more regular posts, with probably little things such as programming challenges, since I am currently not that interesting in penetration testing at the moment and instead I will try and provide news on the latest Cybersecurity threats and issues we are facing today.
